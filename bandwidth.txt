Base commands

OVS is feature rich with different configuration commands, but the majority of your configuration and troubleshooting can be accomplished with the following 4 commands:

    ovs-vsctl : Used for configuring the ovs-vswitchd configuration database (known as ovs-db)
    ovs-ofctl : A command line tool for monitoring and administering OpenFlow switches
    ovs-dpctl : Used to administer Open vSwitch datapaths
    ovs−appctl : Used for querying and controlling Open vSwitch daemons



mininet> s1 ovs-vsctl set interface s1-eth1 ingress_policing_rate=50000
mininet> s1 ovs-vsctl set interface s1-eth1 ingress_policing_burst=5000
mininet> s1 ovs-vsctl set interface s1-eth4 ingress_policing_rate=5000
mininet> s1 ovs-vsctl set interface s1-eth4 ingress_policing_burst=500
//setting up the ingress values per interface


mininet> s1 ovs-vsctl list interface s1-eth4
//to see the set up ingress limits
